This is the Ma lab, Evolutionary Genomics of Sex, Github page. 

The lab studies what drives sexual dimorphism, and the genomic, transcriptomic and molecular basis underlying the differences between the sexes across the tree of life. Major research themes include evolution and origin of sex chromosome recombination suppression and degeneration, sex determination, and evolution and consequences of asex. Her lab integrates the cutting-edge OMICs approaches with natural variation, experimental evolution, and selection to study the relationship between genotype and complex sex phenotypes. 

In this Github page, we will share codes for various related projects. All published projects codes will be public, yet other in progress projects codes could be private and shared among lab members only.
